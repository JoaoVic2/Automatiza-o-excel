# Transposing Rows to Columns in CSV File and Converting to Excel

This Python script reads a CSV file, transposes the rows into columns, converts the data to an Excel (XLSX) file, and adds a specific header to the columns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `openpyxl`
  - `pandas`

## How it Works

1. **Obtaining Current Date:**
   - The script fetches the current date and formats it as YYYYMMDD.

2. **Reading and Converting CSV to Excel:**
   - The script reads the CSV file with the name formatted by the obtained date.
   - CSV data is converted to a `pandas` DataFrame.
   - Subsequently, the data is written to an Excel (XLSX) file with the same name as the CSV.

3. **Adding Header to Excel:**
   - A specific header is defined for the Excel columns.
   - The script loads the newly created Excel file using `openpyxl`.
   - The header is inserted into the first row of the worksheet.

4. **Saving Excel with Header:**
   - The Excel worksheet is saved with the new header.

5. **Removal of Temporary Files:**
   - Temporary files created during the process are removed from the system.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed in your environment.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running `pip install openpyxl pandas`.
3. Execute the Python script. It will read the CSV file, perform the described operations, and save the result in the same directory.
4. Check the resulting files with the transposed and converted data in Excel.

This script simplifies the process of transposing rows into columns in a CSV file and converting it to Excel, providing a specific header for the columns.
